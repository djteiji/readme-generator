# Professional README Generator Starter Code
Weekly Challenge #9

## Purpose
Create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package

- When the application is run from the command line, the user is prompted with a series of questions about their project.

- User is prompted to input information including project title, project description, installation instructions, usage information, guidelines for contributions, and testing.

- User is also prompted to select which type of license the application will operate under. The corresponding license badge is added to the README file, which will link to the license description.

- User is then prompted to enter their GitHub username and email address, so they can be contacted with any questions.
